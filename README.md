Hi,

This is a light-weight directed graph implementation. 

It stores arcs (directed edges) in linked lists.

It supports weighted graphs, self-pointing arcs, multiple arcs from one node to another.

Currently it doesn't do much. I'm adding a shortest path algorithm which uses a queue and utilizes breadth-first search (so-called Dijkstra method). I don't know what to add after that though. Maybe A* path finding or maybe some connectivity checking, depth-first search. I don't know.

There is more to be said but I guess comments inside code should be enough. I am also writing a detailed blog post, will write the address here.
