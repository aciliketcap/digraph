Hi,

This is a light-weight directed graph implementation. 

It stores arcs (directed edges) in linked lists.

It supports weighted graphs, self-pointing arcs, multiple arcs from one node to another.

I also added shortest path finding (non-weighted) by using Dijkstra's algorithm. I'll add weighted version too. Maybe I can add A* after that.

More functionality would be nice, like connectivity checking, depth-first search etc. I don't know if I'll have time for those though.

There is more to be said but I guess comments inside the source should be enough. I am also writing a detailed blog post, will write the address here.
