Hi,

I'm working on a digraph implementation using C++.

It's base is complete. I need to write functions which do the "directed graph stuff". Like shortest path finding, connectivity checking, checking various graph properties like balance etc. 

Also I need to clean up the source and comments. 

I'm putting it on GitHub to save its current state. It's the first working version and some of the comments I'm going to delete can mean something to anyone reading the codes later state. 

So I'll update all the files in a short time but this version will remain on GitHub.
